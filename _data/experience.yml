    At Level, I navigate MindBody in order to organize schedules for our Personal Trainers and check in our members. Receptionists at Level also function as a sort of sales associate. I show prospective members our facilities and talk them through any possible training they may go through with any of our trainers.

    I taught children from ages 3+ how to swim and supervised them as they demonstrated skills in the pool. I also coached older children and teenagers from 8-16 to swim competitively by using intensive swim workouts as well as dry-land exercizes.
