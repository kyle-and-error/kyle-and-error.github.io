  Hi, my name is Kyle and I’m a Computer Science student at Elon University and a Le Wagon Alumni (Batch #269). I plan to graduate from Elon in 2023. I'm extremely interested in the creative potential of programming in both games and applications. I’m proficient in various programming languages, including Python, GameMakerStudio, and Ruby. I am a freelance tutor (Hire me!) and former swim coach. I am currently looking for employment!

            I taught children from ages 3+ how to swim and supervised them as they demonstrated skills in the pool. I also coached older children and teenagers from 8-16 to swim competitively by using intensive swim workouts as well as dry-land exercizes.
