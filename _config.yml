  Hi, my name is Kyle and I'm a Computer Science student at Elon University. I'm extremely interested in the creative potential of programming in both games and applications. I'm proficient in GameMaker Studio 2, mySQL, and a number of Object Oriented Programming languages. I am a Le Wagon Alumni (Batch #269), and plan to graduate from Elon University in 2023.
  
  Hi, my name is Kyle and I’m a Computer Science student at Elon University and a Le Wagon Alumni (Batch #269). I plan to graduate from Elon in 2023. I’m proficient in GameMaker Studio 2, mySQL, and a number of Object Oriented Programming languages. I have worked as a freelance tutor and  a swim coach. I am working on several projects: a personal website, a SmartHome web app that can enable control from different voice assistants, and a RPG built in GameMaker Studio 2.

            I taught children from ages 3+ how to swim and supervised them as they demonstrated skills in the pool. I also coached older children and teenagers from 8-16 to swim competitively by using intensive swim workouts as well as dry-land exercizes.
