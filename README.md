A resume built with the help of [sproogden's modern resume theme](https://github.com/sproogen/modern-resume-theme). I used their project to help construct my own resume website. 

Feel free to use my project as a template. I essentially combined sproogden's [V1 (Version 1 Readme)](https://github.com/sproogen/modern-resume-theme/blob/1.x/README.md) and [V2 (Version 2 Readme)](https://github.com/sproogen/modern-resume-theme/blob/master/README.md), as well as added some features of my own like a place for your pronouns.

This guide is here to help you set up

## Installation & setup guide
This template is designed to be hosted using GitHub pages and so that's what these instructions will cover. If you plan on hosting it seperately then there might be some extra steps that we wont cover.

Before starting it might be useful to familiarise yourself with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/), [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started) and [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

### Step 1 - GitHub
Start by creating an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/join)

### Step 2 - Create Repository
Create a repository on GitHub to hold your files and host your resume. You can find out how to do that [here](https://pages.github.com/)

### Step 3 - Download Resume Template
Download and extract the following zip into the git repository you have just created. [resume-template.zip]()

### Step 4 - Push it
Commit and push the resume template to github
```
$ git add --all
$ git commit -m "Initial resume setup"
$ git push -u origin master
```
### Step 5 - See it
You should now be able to see the demo resume template using this theme at `[your-username].github.io`
